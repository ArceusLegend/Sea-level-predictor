# Sea-level-predictor
A short python project plotting data on sea levels from 1880-2013

# Plotting data with matplotlib
Creates a scatter plot of data from epa-sea-level.csv. Afterwards, it plots 2 lines of best fit, to try and predict the possible sea level in 2050 based on its rate of change in 1880 and then in 2000

# Data used was collected by CSIRO, but it also includes some data from NOAA as well
The original file was published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and can be found here: https://datahub.io/core/sea-level-rise
The only change I made in the repo's provided file was removing one empty line that caused the code to misbehave
